# __Overview of the Project__
Our project consisted of a data analysis and breadth-driven approach for determining the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on the metric of safety. We incorporated a wide variety of societal aspects in the analysis to provide a wholistic and information complete result as well as accurate findings for safety efficacy. Our final analysis for finding the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh emcompassed a variety of community aspects that help a society function safely and effectively, and these include social services, crime arrests, public schools, and house property sales. These submetrics were intentionally chosen to measure and test the success of a neighborhood in multiple subdomains like education, economy (housing market), public service, and justice which are all necessary for the ideal society.
